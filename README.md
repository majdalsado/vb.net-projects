# VB.NET Projects
Collection of some of my first applications created in VB.NET back in 2010. These were my first few experiments with programming as a curious 14 year old.
These application were mostly created for my own amusement and functions served are very niche to my needs at the time. There is no malicious intent in any application however I cannot be held liable for any damage possibly caused. 
The compiled executable can be found in each project folders /bin/Debug folder
